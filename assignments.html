#HW5: Wireframe/Prototype
Reading
Part 3
Chapter 16, 17, 18, 19, 20
In this assignment, you will create a website wireframe by hand and prototype it with HTML and CSS. This design will serve as the basis for your next website.
Part 1
Using pencil and paper or collage, create a page layout that represents the design of your next website. This is an opportunity for you to make design decisions before applying them with code. The layout should include text, images, and navigation. You need not concern yourself with specific content at this stage; instead, focus on the arrangement of compositional elements on the page. When you have completed your handmade wireframe, take a picture of it or scan it so that you have a digital image of your work.
Part 2
Now that you have an idea of what your page should look like, prototype it with HTML and CSS. This is still part of the wireframing process so you don't need to work with content-specific images and text-here is some placeholder text and a placeholder image that you can use. Your goal is to translate the drawing/collage you made in Part 1 with HTML and CSS code. To that end, you should incorporate the CSS flex and position properties in your stylesheet. When you have completed your prototypal wireframe, upload the page to i6.
Submitting Your Assignment
Submit the following via NYU Classes.
A digital photo or scan of your handmade wireframe
The URL to your wireframe page on i6
A compressed archive containing all the files of your HTML and CSS wireframe
Grading
This assignment is worth 10 points.
A digital image of the student's handmade website wireframe (1 point)
The handmade wireframe should thoughtfully represent the layout of text, image, and navigation (3 points)
An HTML and CSS prototype of the wireframe, published to i6 (3 points)
The prototypal wireframe should be a good translation of the handmade wireframe (1 point)
The CSS flex property should be applied to the layout (1 point)
The CSS position property should be applied to the layout (1 point)
Extra Credit: Design and provide a flowchart image created with DRAW.io

#HW6: Responsive Web
In this assignment, you will create a new website that incorporates CSS media queries into the design. This will allow your page layout to change based on whether a visitor to your site is using a smartphone, tablet, or desktop computer. With media queries, you can anticipate and design for a variety of viewing experiences.
New Website
Using the design you created in the Wireframing assignment as your guide, create a new website of at least four pages. The subject matter of the site is up to you but should be a topic of academic interest—whether related to your major or an area of specialized knowledge. Each of the web pages should include images and/or text and there should be clear navigation between each of the pages.
Media Queries
Next, you will create three different CSS style sheets: "mobile.css," "tablet.css," and "desktop.css." Link to your external style sheets with the following code. This goes inside the head section of each of your HTML documents.
<!-- Media query for narrow browser width -->
<link rel="stylesheet" media="only screen and (max-width: 480px)" href="mobile.css">

<!-- Media query for medium browser width -->
<link rel="stylesheet" media="only screen and (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 960px)" href="tablet.css">

<!-- Media query for full browser width -->
<link rel="stylesheet" media="only screen and (min-width: 961px)" href="desktop.css">

<!-- Prevent smartphones from scaling pages down -->
<meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1">

As the comments indicate, these media queries assess a viewer's browser width and use that information to determine which of three style sheets to use for the page: mobile.css, tablet.css, or desktop.css. Make sure these links match your CSS file names and their location.
Alternate Style Sheets
Now that your Web pages have the flexibility to access different style sheets, the next step is to optimize the layout with CSS for each of the widths specified. For example, a three-column layout could be used for desktop viewing, a two-column layout for tablets, and a one-column layout for smartphones. You should structure your HTML code with div tags in order to align sections of content alongside each other when appropriate. In addition to layout changes, feel free to tweak the formatting to optimize each of the three style sheets.
Here is a list of required elements to include.
Add media queries to each of your HTML pages to choose among alternate style sheets. Feel free to copy and paste the code above.
Create three separate CSS style sheets - desktop.css, tablet.css, and mobile.css - that correspond to the media queries.
Add div tags to logical column sections of your HTML documents.
Add style rules that allow your divs to align next to each other.
Modify each style sheet for optimal viewing with different browser widths.
Submitting Your Assignment
Upload your site files to the i6 Unix server. Your files and directories should go in the i6 directory called "public_html." Test your pages again once they are live on the Web server, varying browser width to observe style changes.
Submit the following via NYU Classes.
The URL to your assignment in the general form of: http://i6.cims.nyu.edu/~netid/

A compressed archive containing all the files (HTML, CSS, and images) of your website
Grading
This assignment is worth 10 points.
A new website of at least five HTML pages with images, text, and hyperlinks (4 points)
Media queries on each page and three different style sheets associated with the media queries (3 points)

The CSS flex property used to position div sections next to other sections (1 point)
Smartphone layout should be optimized for narrow browser widths; tablet and desktop layouts should be optimized for wider browsers (1 point)


#HW7: Bootstrap
Reading
Chapter 21 and 22
In this assignment, you will create a new website using the front end Web framework, Bootstrap.
Getting Started
To get started, you will install Bootstrap and make a copy of the Bootstrap starter template.
Install Bootstrap.
Make a project folder called "causeSite," where you will put all your files for this assignment.
Follow instructions for installing Bootstrap. This is simply a matter of downloading a copy of the Bootstrap files and placing them into your project folder. Your bootstrap folder should end up with three sub-folders: css, fonts, and js.
Create an HTML page.
Copy and paste the HTML source code for the Bootstrap starter template, and save it into your own HTML file named "index.html" in your project folder
Edit this HTML code and modify the link to the "Bootstrap core CSS" file so that it correctly points to the CSS file where you have saved it when you installed bootstrap, which is css/bootstrap.min.css
Edit this HTML code and modify the link to the "Custom styles for this template" so that it points to a new file you will make, which is css/custom.css
Create a custom CSS file.
Copy and paste the CSS source code used by the Bootstrap starter template; save it into a new CSS file named "custom.css" within your css folder.
You will add all your custom CSS for this assignment to this file.
Open the HTML page you made in your web browser. Make sure it looks just like the starter template example before proceeding.
Leveraging Bootstrap's Features
Familiarize yourself with the various aspects of working with Bootstrap, including the following.
The built-in CSS classes that can be used to create custom layouts, including grid-based layouts with responsive layouts features
The built-in CSS classes that can be used to style common user interface components, such as buttons, links, navbars, and thumbnail images
The built-in CSS classes that can be used to create interactive widgets, such as carousels, tabs, and drop-down menus
Customizing the Default Theme
You can quickly and easily change the default style of components and interactive widgets by following the customization workflow outlined on the Bootstrap site.
For each element you want to customize, find its code in the compiled Bootstrap CSS
Copy the component's selector and styles and paste them in your custom stylesheet. For instance, to customize the navbar background, just copy the .navbar style specification.
In your custom stylesheet, edit the CSS you just copied from the Bootstrap source.
Continue this process until you're happy with your customizations and have reached your design goals.
Requirements
Here is a list of required elements to include.
Create at least 3 pages of content with a consistent style
Create the general page layout on each page using Bootstrap's grid layout features
Use a single Bootstrap navigation component on all pages to allow visitors to browse among the 3 pages
Create at least 2 layouts using Bootstrap's responsive design features: one for mobile devices and one for desktop computers
Use Bootstrap's carousel widget, including at least three images
Customize at least 3 Bootstrap components on each page
Beyond these requirements, feel free to explore Bootstrap and take this project as far as you would like! Sites that demonstrate extra effort, thoughtfulness, and creativity will be considered for extra credit.
